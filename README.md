This has some basic default .ycm_extra_conf.py files for various platforms and runtimes.

### Windows 10 with VS 2017
Rename the Windows 10 1803 - VS 2017 Basic .ycm_extra_conf.py to just .ycm_extra_conf.py and copy it to where you want to use it. Like
the root folder of a C++ project with MFC or any other Windows C/C++ based project. _Please Note_ that you will have to add in additional paths for
your project to make the completion engine completely happy.
